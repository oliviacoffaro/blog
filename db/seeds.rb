# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

Be mindful of your personal flow, but Iâ€™ll definitely be wearing them tampon-less. I wore the underwear ALL DAY and did not have a leak. I did not feel wet. In periods past, I would have gone through the work day using at least two tampons, maybe three. Straight up? I was impressed.  I have confidence that they can hold up under pressure. So go forth, my fellow women. Bleed free, bleed proud.", img_url: "http://static.stuff.co.nz/files/thinxad"}, ])
